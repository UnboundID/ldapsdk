<h2>LDAP Result Code Reference</h2>

<p></p>
<p>
  This page provides a reference that lists a number of LDAP result codes and describes some of
  the circumstances under which they may be used.
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Server-Side Result Codes</h3>

<p>
  Various LDAP specifications define a number of common result codes that may be included in
  responses to clients.  These result codes include (but are not necessarily limited to):
</p>


<br>
<h4>0:  Success</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the operation completed successfully.  It may be returned in response to an
  add, bind, delete, extended, modify, modify DN, or search operations.
</p>

<p>
  Compare operations will not return a success result.  If a compare operation does not encounter
  an error during processing, then the server should return a result of either "compare true" or
  "compare false", based on whether the target entry had the specified attribute value.
</p>


<br>
<h4>1:  Operations Error</h4>
<p>
  This is intended to indicate that the client has requested an operation at an inappropriate
  time or in an incorrect order.  For example, it may be used if a client sends a non-bind request
  in the middle of a multi-stage bind operation.
</p>

<p>
  Note that some directory servers use this as a generic "server error" type result.  This is not
  the intended use for this result code (the "other" result is a better choice for this), but
  clients may need to be aware of this possibility.
</p>


<br>
<h4>2:  Protocol Error</h4>
<p>
  This generally indicates that the client request was improperly formatted in some way.  For a
  bind operation, it may indicate that the client attempted to use an unsupported LDAP protocol
  version.  For an extended operation, it may indicate that the server does not support the
  extended request type.
</p>

<p>
  Note that this result code can only be used if the server is able to at least partially decode
  the request in order to determine the message ID and operation type, since the server needs that
  information in order to craft an appropriate response.
</p>


<br>
<h4>3:  Time Limit Exceeded</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a search operation took longer to complete than allowed by the maximum time
  limit for that operation.  This may be the time limit specified by the client in the search
  request, or it may be a time limit imposed by the server.
</p>


<br>
<h4>4:  Size Limit Exceeded</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a search operation would have returned more entries than were allowed for
  that operation.  This may be the size limit specified by the client in the search request, or it
  may be a size limit imposed by the server.  Note that the server may return a portion of the
  matching entries before this result.
</p>


<br>
<h4>5:  Compare False</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a compare operation was processed successfully but that the target entry did
  not match the provided attribute value assertion.
</p>


<br>
<h4>6:  Compare True</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a compare operation was processed successfully and that the target entry
  matched the provided attribute value assertion.
</p>


<br>
<h4>7:  Authentication Method Not Supported</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a bind operation failed because the server does not support the requested
  authentication type.
</p>


<br>
<h4>8:  Stronger Authentication Required</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server requires that the client be authenticated with a stronger
  mechanism than has previously been performed in order to process the request.
</p>

<p>
  This result code may be used in a notice of disconnection unsolicited notification if the server
  believes that the security of the connection has been compromised.
</p>


<br>
<h4>10:  Referral</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server could not process the requested operation, but that it may
  succeed if attempted in another location, as specified by the referral URIs included in the
  response.
</p>


<br>
<h4>11:  Administrative Limit Exceeded</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an administrative limit was exceeded while processing the request.  For
  example, some directory servers use this response to indicate that it would have required
  examining too many entries to process the request.
</p>


<br>
<h4>12:  Unavailable Critical Extension</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the request included a critical control that was not recognized or could not
  be processed.
</p>


<br>
<h4>13:  Confidentiality Required</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation is only allowed over a secure connection.
</p>


<br>
<h4>14:  SASL Bind in Progress</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server requires more information from the client in order to complete
  the SASL bind operation.  In such responses, the "server SASL credentials" element of the result
  message will often include information the client needs for subsequent phases of bind
  processing.
</p>


<br>
<h4>16:  No Such Attribute</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client attempted to interact with an attribute that does not exist in
  the target entry (e.g., to remove an attribute or value that does not exist).
</p>


<br>
<h4>17:  Undefined Attribute Type</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request included an attribute type that is not defined in the
  server schema.
</p>


<br>
<h4>18:  Inappropriate Matching</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request attempted to perform an unsupported type of matching
  against an attribute.  For example, this may be used if the attribute type does not have an
  appropriate matching rule for the type of matching requested for that attribute.
</p>


<br>
<h4>19:  Constraint Violation</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request would have caused the server to violate some constraint
  defined in the server (e.g., to add more than one value to a single-valued attribute).
</p>


<br>
<h4>20:  Attribute or Value Exists</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request attempted to add an attribute or value to an entry that
  already contained that attribute or value.
</p>


<br>
<h4>21:  Invalid Attribute Syntax</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request would have resulted in an attribute value that did not
  conform to the syntax for that attribute type.
</p>


<br>
<h4>32:  No Such Object</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client request targeted an entry that does not exist.  Note that some
  servers use this result for a bind request that targets a nonexistent user, even though "invalid
  credentials" is a more appropriate result for that case.
</p>


<br>
<h4>33:  Alias Problem</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a problem was encountered while interacting with an alias entry (e.g., the
  alias refers to an entry that does not exist).
</p>


<br>
<h4>34:  Invalid DN Syntax</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the request included a malformed or invalid DN or RDN.
</p>


<br>
<h4>36:  Alias Dereferencing Problem</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client attempted to interact with an alias entry in a manner that was
  not allowed (e.g., for an operation that does not allow the use of aliases, or if the client
  does not have permission to access the entry referenced by the alias).
</p>


<br>
<h4>48:  Inappropriate Authentication</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client attempted to perform a type of authentication that is not allowed
  for the target user (e.g., because the user does not have the necessary credentials for that
  type of authentication).  This may also indicate that the client attempted to perform anonymous
  authentication when that is not allowed.
</p>


<br>
<h4>49:  Invalid Credentials</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client attempted to bind as a user that does not exist, attempted to
  bind as a user that is not allowed to bind (e.g., because it has expired, because it has been
  locked because of too many failed authentication attempts, etc.), or attempted to bind with
  credentials that were not correct for the target user.
</p>


<br>
<h4>50:  Insufficient Access Rights</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client does not have permission to perform the requested operation.
</p>


<br>
<h4>51:  Busy</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server is currently too busy to process the requested operation.
</p>


<br>
<h4>52:  Unavailable</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server is currently unavailable (e.g., because it is being shut down or
  is in a maintenance state).
</p>


<br>
<h4>53:  Unwilling to Perform</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server is unwilling to process the requested operation for some reason.
</p>


<br>
<h4>54:  Loop Detected</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the server has detected an internal loop while processing the requested
  operation (e.g., if two alias entries reference each other).
</p>


<br>
<h4>60:  Sort Control Missing</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the search request included a virtual list view request control without also
  including the required server-side sort request control.
</p>


<br>
<h4>61:  Offset Range Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the search request included a virtual list view request control with an
  invalid offset or content count.
</p>


<br>
<h4>64:  Naming Violation</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested add or modify DN operation would have resulted in an entry
  that violates server naming restrictions (e.g., as might be imposed by a name form defined in
  the server schema).
</p>


<br>
<h4>65:  Object Class Violation</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation would have resulted in an entry that violates schema
  restrictions imposed by its object classes (e.g., to include an attribute that is not allowed to
  be present in the entry, or to omit an attribute that is required to be present in the entry).
</p>


<br>
<h4>66:  Not Allowed on Non-Leaf Entry</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation cannot be performed against an entry that has one or
  more subordinate entries.  For example, a delete operation is normally not allowed to remove an
  entry that has one or more subordinates.
</p>


<br>
<h4>67:  Not Allowed on RDN</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation is not allowed because it would have altered the
  entry to remove an attribute value used in the entry's RDN.
</p>


<br>
<h4>68:  Entry Already Exists</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested add or modify DN operation could not be processed because
  another entry already exists with the DN that would have resulted from that operation.
</p>


<br>
<h4>69:  Object Class Modifications Prohibited</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation would have resulted in a disallowed change to the
  object classes contained in the entry (e.g., the operation would have changed the entry's
  structural object class).
</p>


<br>
<h4>71:  Affects Multiple DSAs</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation could not be processed because it would have
  required interacting with data in multiple directory server instances in a way that is not
  supported.
</p>


<br>
<h4>76:  Virtual List View Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a search operation failed because of processing associated with a virtual
  list view request control included in the request (e.g., if a necessary index was not in place
  to facilitate the virtual list view processing).
</p>


<br>
<h4>80:  Other</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that some problem was encountered during processing that is not covered by any of
  the other defined result codes (e.g., a server error).
</p>


<br>
<h4>118:  Canceled</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an operation was canceled through the use of the cancel extended request.
  If an operation is canceled in this way, then this result code will be used for both the
  operation that was canceled and for the cancel extended operation itself.
</p>


<br>
<h4>119:  No Such Operation</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an attempt to cancel an operation via the cancel extended request was not
  successful because the server did not have any knowledge of the target operation.  This often
  means that the server had already completed processing for the operation by the time it received
  and attempted to process the cancel request.
</p>


<br>
<h4>120:  Too Late</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an attempt to cancel an operation via the cancel extended request was not
  successful because processing for that operation had already reached a point beyond which it
  could be canceled.
</p>


<br>
<h4>121:  Cannot Cancel</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an attempt to cancel an operation via the cancel extended request was not
  successful because the target operation is not an operation that can be canceled.  Operations
  that cannot be canceled include abandon, bind, unbind, and the cancel and StartTLS extended
  operations.
</p>


<br>
<h4>122:  Assertion Failed</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation could not be processed because the request included
  an LDAP assertion request control, but the assertion filter did not match the target entry.
</p>


<br>
<h4>123:  Authorization Denied</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the requested operation could not be processed because the request included
  a proxied authorization request control (or some similar control intended to specify an
  alternate authorization identity for the operation), but the client was not allowed to request
  the use of that alternate authorization identity.
</p>


<br>
<h4>4096:  Synchronization Refresh Required</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an attempt to use the content synchronization request control in order to
  perform an incremental update failed for some reason and the client will instead need to request
  an initial content.
</p>


<br>
<h4>16654:  No Operation</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the associated operation would likely have succeeded, to the extent that
  the server was able to make the determination, but was not actually processed because the
  request included the LDAP no operation control.  Note that at present, the numeric value for
  this result code is not an official standard because the specification for the no operation
  request control has not progressed far enough to be assigned an official numeric value, but the
  value 16654 is in common use by a number of servers for this purpose.
</p>



<br><br>
<h3>Client-Side Result Codes</h3>

<p>
  There are also a number of result codes that are not intended to be returned by LDAP servers,
  but may still be useful to indicate problems that may arise in LDAP client applications.  These
  client-side result codes include those listed below:
</p>


<br>
<h4>81:  Server Down</h4>
<p>
  This generally indicates that a previously-established connection is no longer valid.  It may
  indicate that the server to which the connection was established has shut down, but it could
  also mean that the connection was closed or has become invalid for some other reason (e.g., the
  client was idle for too long, there was a network outage, etc.).
</p>


<br>
<h4>82:  Local Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that some client-side problem occurred that interfered with its ability to
  interact with a directory server.  This should generally be used when no other client-side
  result code is more appropriate.
</p>


<br>
<h4>83:  Encoding Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client-side problem was encountered while attempting to encode a request
  to send to a directory server.
</p>


<br>
<h4>84:  Decoding Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client-side problem was encountered while attempting to decode a request
  received from a directory server.
</p>


<br>
<h4>85:  Timeout</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client-side timeout was encountered while waiting for a response to an
  LDAP request.
</p>


<br>
<h4>86:  Authentication Unknown</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client application attempted to use an unknown authentication type.
</p>


<br>
<h4>87:  Filter Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client-side problem was encountered while interacting with a search filter
  (e.g., if the client failed to parse a string as a search filter).
</p>


<br>
<h4>88:  User Canceled</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an operation was interrupted on the client before a response was received
  from the directory server.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that the associated
  operation was aborted in the server, and it is entirely possible that an operation that was
  canceled on the client still succeeded in the server.
</p>


<br>
<h4>89:  Parameter Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that some invalid parameter was provided to an LDAP client that prevented it from
  conducting the desired processing.
</p>


<br>
<h4>90:  No Memory</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client ran out of memory when attempting to process the requested
  operation, or that the client was able to determine that the operation would have consumed too
  much of the client's memory.
</p>


<br>
<h4>91:  Connect Error</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that an LDAP client was unable to successfully establish a connection to the
  directory server.  This may suggest that the client was unable to establish the underlying TCP
  connection, or that a problem was encountered while attempting to negotiate a security layer on
  top of it in a manner that was not related to LDAP communication.
</p>


<br>
<h4>92:  Not Supported</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that a client attempted to do something that was not supported by the LDAP API
  used by that client.
</p>


<br>
<h4>93:  Control Not Found</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client expected to find a particular control in a request or response,
  but that control was not present.
</p>


<br>
<h4>94:  No Results Returned</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client did not receive any search results for an operation in which
  results were expected.
</p>


<br>
<h4>95:  More Results to Return</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client has received or conveyed a portion of the search results for an
  operation, but there are still more results to be retrieved.
</p>


<br>
<h4>96:  Client Loop</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that the client encountered some kind of a loop during processing.  This
  generally indicates that a referral loop was encountered, in which attempting to follow a
  referral ends eventually causes the client to encounter the same referral multiple times.
</p>


<br>
<h4>97:  Referral Limit Exceeded</h4>
<p>
  This indicates that, in the attempt to follow a referral, the client encountered one or more
  additional referrals and reached the limit of the number of referral hops it is willing to
  follow.
</p>
