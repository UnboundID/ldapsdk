              <h2>Release Notes</h2>

              <h3>Version 1.0.0</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.10 and 1.0.0 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the code used to read server responses so that it uses a result code of
                  "server down" rather than "protocol error" whenever an I/O error occurs while
                  reading the response.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added support for the permissive modify control, which may be used to request
                  that the directory server accept modify requests which attempt to add an
                  attribute value that already exists in the target entry, or to remove an
                  attribute value which does not exist in the target entry.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the code used to parse schema elements to be more lenient and
                  standards-compliant when handling optional spaces in definitions.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>LDAPThreadLocalConnectionPool</tt> class, which is very similar
                  to the existing <tt>LDAPConnectionPool</tt> class, except that it uses a
                  thread-local mechanism to maintain a separate connection for each client thread
                  that attempts to communicate with the server.  This can help eliminate some
                  thread contention, and can help avoid the need to define an explicit size for
                  the pool, since it will have as many connections as threads attempting to use
                  the pool.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to create a <tt>Schema</tt> object by reading schema
                  definitions from one or more LDIF files.  It was previously only possible to
                  read schema information from a directory server over LDAP.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to provide the ability to reject entries containing
                  duplicate values for the same attribute.  Previously, if an entry had multiple
                  occurrences of the same value for the same attribute, the LDIF reader would
                  simply silently ignore the duplicate values.  This is still the default
                  behavior, but it is now possible to configure the LDIF reader to reject
                  entries with duplicate attribute values.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to provide the ability to use schema information when
                  reading entries and change records.  This can be used to help better handle
                  treatment of different values which might have otherwise been considered
                  duplicates using the default case-ignore string matching rule (e.g., attributes
                  that should use case-exact matching and have values that differ only in
                  capitalization).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the validate-ldif tool provided with the LDAP SDK so that it offers the
                  ability to use schema definitions read from files rather than over LDAP (so that
                  it can be used in a completely offline manner).  It will also now reject entries
                  with duplicate attribute values by default, but provides an option to ignore such
                  errors.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>EntryValidator</tt> class so that it properly handles entries
                  with the <tt>extensibleObject</tt> object class.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent LDAP connection statistics from being updated for
                  asynchronous search operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added convenience methods to the <tt>Attribute</tt> and <tt>Entry</tt> classes
                  which may be used to retrieve attribute values as DNs.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added convenience methods to the <tt>DN</tt> and <tt>Entry</tt> classes which
                  may be used to determine whether a given DN or entry is within the range of a
                  specified search base and scope.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 0.9.10</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.9 and 0.9.10 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the schema parsing code so that schema elements will be held in ordered
                  maps so that they can be accessed in the order they were returned by the server.
                  This can help ensure that order-based dependencies (e.g., an object class which
                  inherits from a superior class) may be properly maintained if they are returned
                  from the server in that order.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the schema parsing code that incorrectly selected a generalized
                  time matching rule when it should have chosen an integer matching rule.  This
                  could cause the validate-ldif tool to incorrectly report syntax violations for
                  data using an integer syntax, along with other failures for code relying on this
                  capability in the LDAP SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to add an option to operate in synchronous mode.  For
                  connections which do not need to invoke asynchronous operations and which will
                  not be used concurrently by multiple threads, then the application can use the
                  <tt>LDAPConnectionOptions.setUseSynchronousMode(true)</tt> method to enable
                  synchronous mode for the connection options before connecting to the directory
                  server.  When in this mode, responses will be read by the same thread which sent
                  the request, rather than by a separate reader thread.  This can significantly
                  improve performance when communicating with the server.
                  <br><br>
                  Other performance improvements have also been made in the LDAP SDK which may
                  benefit both the default asynchronous mode as well as the new synchronous
                  mode.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could cause intermittent failures with a "server down" result
                  in which the connection was terminated.  The problem would be triggered if the
                  client could not read an entire LDAP message at once and there was a significant
                  delay of greater than 50 milliseconds when attempting to read additional data as
                  part of the message.  This could cause the SDK to attempt to read the middle of
                  an LDAP message as if it were the beginning, which would cause a decoding
                  failure that would trigger the SDK to terminate the connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the ObjectClassDefinition class that caused it to ignore the
                  recursive argument.  Previously, it would always recursively get all superior
                  classes even if the recursive argument was set to false.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that prevented entries returned by automatically following a
                  referral from being included in the search result entry count.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAPSearch example tool to include an option for following referrals
                  encountered during processing.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>


              <h3>Version 0.9.9</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.8 and 0.9.9 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the javadoc documentation to make the EntrySource API (and in particular
                  the LDAPEntrySource class) more visible.  References to LDAPEntrySource are now
                  present in the class-level documentation for the SearchRequest class and
                  SearchResultListener interface.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new SearchResultReferenceEntrySourceException as a subclass of
                  EntrySourceException that will be thrown if a search result reference is returned
                  when using the LDAPEntrySource class.  This makes it easier to access the
                  contents of any search result references returned through this API.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added LDAPException.hasControl methods that mirror the LDAPResult.hasControl
                  methods and provide additional convenience when working with controls in results
                  for operations that returned with a non-successful result.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Placed a maximum size on the blocking queue used to hold search result entries
                  and references while waiting for them to be processed.  This can help prevent
                  problems in which a client could be potentially overwhelmed or required to use a
                  lot of memory for a search that returns a large number of entries when a search
                  result listener is used and the client cannot process entries as quickly as they
                  are returned.  If the queue becomes full, then the LDAP SDK will push back
                  against the directory server so that it will only be able to send entries as
                  fast as the client can consume them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to control automatic referral following at a per-request level.
                  By default, the LDAP SDK will still use the behavior defined at the connection
                  level, but it is now possible to override that on a per-request level if desired.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to include a call stack trace in debug log messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP connection pool implementation to ensure that the auto-reconnect
                  connection option is ignored for connections which are part of a connection pool.
                  In some cases, the use of this option for pooled connections could cause
                  connections to be re-established when the pool had attempted to close them.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to assign user-friendly names to connections and connection
                  pools.  This can be helpful in applications which maintain multiple connections
                  or connection pools for different purposes.  The name of the connection or
                  connection pool can be queried via code and will also appear in the names of the
                  threads used to read responses from the directory server for those connections so
                  that they will be more visible in thread stack traces.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the LDIF writer that could cause an extra space to be added to the
                  beginning of the last line of a multi-line comment.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pool implementations so that releasing a defunct
                  connection will not automatically cause a new connection to be created to replace
                  it if the pool already has the maximum number of available connections.
                  Previously, the connection pool could have created and then immediately closed
                  a connection in that scenario.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added additional connection pool statistics that can be used to help distinguish
                  between differences in behavior when a connection was successfully checked out of
                  the pool.  It is now possible to differentiate between cases in which an
                  existing connection was returned without any wait, an existing connection was
                  returned after waiting for it to become available, or a new connection was
                  created to return to the client.  This can help make information available for
                  applications to understand whether their connection pools are sized
                  appropriately.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to change the manner in which a connection is closed if it
                  is done by the Java finalizer (which would presumably only occur if a connection
                  was leaked by the application using it).  If the connection is part of a
                  connection pool, then it will now simply be terminated rather than released back
                  to the pool as a defunct connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Made the LDAPRequest.getLastMessageID() method public.  This was previously used
                  internally, but may be useful when trying to cancel a synchronous request from a
                  different thread.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to control the send and receive buffer sizes for sockets used
                  when communicating with the directory server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDAP SDK to provide better information to clients in the event that a
                  connection is terminated because of an unrecoverable error encountered while
                  reading responses from the directory server.  This information was previously
                  only available through the debugging framework, but the LDAP SDK will now attempt
                  to generate a response to provide to the client with information about the
                  failure so that it will be available when debugging isn't enabled.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a static Attribute.getBaseName(String) method that may be used to retrieve
                  the base name without any attribute options for a specified attribute
                  description.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the format of LDAP SDK debug messages to make them more consistent and
                  easier to parse.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to capture a thread stack trace at the time that an attempt is
                  made to establish a connection.  This can be useful for debugging purposes,
                  especially for tracking down the source of a leaked connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to update an Entry object with one or more modifications.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent the LDAP SDK from correctly following referrals
                  for search operations.

              <h3>Version 0.9.8</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.7 and 0.9.8 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could prevent the LDAP SDK from returning a response to the
                  StartTLS extended request if the server certificate was not trusted.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug that could cause the connection pool implementation to leak a
                  connection when performing a background health check if that connection was
                  examined multiple times in the same health check sequence.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a bug in the <tt>LDAPConnectionPool.getRootDSE()</tt> method in which it
                  could inadvertently check out two connections when only one was required.  Both
                  connections were properly returned to the pool, but holding the unnecessary
                  connection could create an artificial shortage of available connections.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a problem that caused the name of the background thread used by the
                  internal <tt>LDAPConnectionReader</tt> class to be set to "Connection reader for
                  LDAPConnection(not connected)" even when the connection was established.  This
                  has been changed so that it will be "Connection reader for {host}:{port}" when
                  the connection is established, and "Connection reader for {host}:{port} (closed)"
                  when the connection has been closed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>com.unboundid.util.FixedRateBarrier</tt> class which can be used
                  to help try to perform operations no faster than a specified rate.  The authrate,
                  modrate, and searchrate tools have been updated to include a new
                  "<tt>--ratePerSecond</tt>" argument that can be used to attempt to process
                  authentications, modifies, and searches at the specified rate.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>CompareRequest</tt> class to make the
                  <tt>setAssertionValue(ASN1OctetString)</tt> method public, since it can be useful
                  in code outside of the LDAP SDK itself.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added an <tt>Attribute.getMatchingRule()</tt> method that can be used to get the
                  matching rule that will be used by default for matching operations involving that
                  attribute.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added the ability to easily convert between <tt>Filter</tt> objects (which are
                  normal search filters) and <tt>MatchedValuesFilter</tt> objects (which are used
                  in the matched values request control).  Not all search filters are valid matched
                  values filters, so an attempt to convert a search filter using an AND, OR, or NOT
                  component, or using an extensible match component with the "dnAttributes" flag
                  set will throw an exception.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Message strings used by the LDAP SDK have been updated so that they use single
                  quotes rather than double quotes.  If the messages generated by the LDAP SDK
                  (especially those included in exceptions) are consumed by and embedded in
                  messages from another application, then single quotes are less likely to create
                  confusion or need escaping if anything tries to parse those messages.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the output of the authrate, modrate, and searchrate tools so that a row
                  of dashes is displayed between the column headings and the data, which moderately
                  improves the appearance.  This will not be used when CSV-formatted output is
                  requested.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 0.9.7</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Further improved the performance of the LDIFReader for entries containing
                  multi-valued attributes.  The change introduced the 0.9.6 version was only
                  applicable for entries with an LDIF representation of at least 100 lines.  The
                  new implementation works for entries of any size and can help dramatically
                  improve read performance for smaller static groups, whereas the previous change
                  only worked for large groups.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new <tt>com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.CompactEntry</tt> class that provides much
                  of the same functionality of the <tt>Entry</tt> class but in a manner that
                  requires much less memory.  This is particularly useful for cases in which it may
                  be necessary to store a large number of entries in memory.  For one test
                  involving typical user entries, CompactEntry has been found to require only about
                  25% as much memory as Entry.  For another test involving static groups with 20
                  members each, CompactEntry has been found to require only about 31% as much
                  memory as Entry.
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Note that some operations involving CompactEntry may not perform as well as with
                  the corresponding methods in the Entry class, so it is generally recommended that
                  CompactEntry only be used when it is necessary to store a large number of entries
                  in memory.  Further, CompactEntry objects are read-only and the API does not
                  expose any way to directly alter their contents.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a potential null pointer exception that could arise as a result of a race
                  condition when closing a connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Made a minor change to the <tt>com.unboundid.ldif.LDIFChangeRecord</tt> class so
                  that the <tt>processChange</tt> method now takes an <tt>LDAPInterface</tt>
                  argument rather than an <tt>LDAPConnection</tt>.  This change is completely
                  backward compatible, since <tt>LDAPConnection</tt> implements
                  <tt>LDAPInterface</tt>, but the new version makes it more convenient to use with
                  connection pools.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added source code for a simple application that allows the UnboundID LDAP SDK for
                  Java to be used to communicate with an LDAP directory server on Android mobile
                  devices.  This application makes it possible to perform searches against an LDAP
                  directory server, and can parse user entries to make it possible to call or
                  e-mail a user found in the directory, show a map of their location, or add
                  information about that user to the device's local contacts.  More information
                  about this application can be found at
                  <a href="http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/using-ldap-on-android/">http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/using-ldap-on-android/</a>,
                  including a video demonstrating its use.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Version 0.9.6</h3>

              <p>
                The following changes were made between the 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 releases:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added support for the LDAP intermediate response protocol op type as described in
                  RFC 3771.  Intermediate responses provide the ability for operations to return
                  multiple responses to a single request.  A new
                  <tt>IntermediateResponseListener</tt> interface has been added, and clients can
                  use the <tt>LDAPRequest.setIntermediateResponseListener</tt> method to indicate
                  that any intermediate response messages returned in response to that request
                  should be made available via that interface.  If no intermediate response
                  listener is defined for a request, then any intermediate response messages
                  returned in response to that request will be silently discarded (although a debug
                  message will be generated).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a problem in the <tt>LDIFReader</tt> class in which it did not properly
                  propagate the <tt>LDIFException</tt> that was thrown if the first line of an
                  LDIF record started with a space.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Fixed a potential problem in the searchrate and modrate tools in which the
                  auto-reconnect flag did not get properly set on the connections that they used.
                  Before this fix, if the connection to the server was lost for some reason, then
                  they would not make any attempt to re-establish the connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a new authrate tool as an example.  It can be used to measure
                  authentication performance, where each authentication consists of a search to
                  retrieve a user entry followed by a bind to verify the password for that user.
                  It supports simple authentication, as well as the CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN
                  SASL mechanisms.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the <tt>CommandLineTool</tt> API to make it possible to include example
                  usages for tools that will be included whenever the usage information is
                  displayed.  This can make it easier to understand how a given tool might be used.
                  The example tools provided with the LDAP SDK have been updated to provide this
                  capability.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pools to provide support for a maximum connection age.
                  If a maximum connection age is defined, then any connection which has been
                  established for a longer period than this will be closed and replaced with a new
                  connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new <tt>LDAPConnectionStatistics</tt> class that can be used to provide
                  information about the processing performed by the LDAP SDK.  The connection
                  statistics can be retrieved using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnection.getConnectionStatistics</tt> method, and they include
                  information about the number of times the connection has been established and
                  closed, the number of times each type of request message has been sent, the
                  number of times each type of response message has been received, and the total
                  and average response times for those operations.  This feature was suggested by
                  Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Created a new <tt>LDAPConnectionPoolStatistics</tt> class that can be used to
                  provide information about the processing performed by the connection pool.  The
                  connection pool statistics can be retrieved using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnectionPool.getConnectionPoolStatistics()</tt> method, and they
                  include the number of connections currently available in the pool, the maximum
                  number of connections that may be maintained in the pool, the number of
                  successful and failed attempts to create connections, the number of connections
                  that have been closed as defunct, expired, or unneeded, the number of successful
                  and failed attempts to retrieve a connection, and the number of valid connections
                  released back to the pool.  This feature was suggested by Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated LDAP connection pools to provide support for connection health checking.
                  Health check implementations may be used to perform custom checks to determine
                  whether a connection is valid at any of the following times:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Whenever a new connection is created for use in the pool</li>
                    <li>Whenever a connection is checked out of the pool</li>
                    <li>Whenever a connection is released back to the pool</li>
                    <li>After an exception has been caught while processing an operation in the
                        pool</li>
                  </ul>
                  In addition, a background thread will be used to periodically invoke health
                  checks against all available connections.  The <tt>ServerSet</tt> API has been
                  updated to provide the ability to make use of a health check in the course of
                  creating new connections.  A health check implementation has been provided that
                  can be used to retrieve a specified entry from the directory server.  The ability
                  or inability to retrieve the entry, as well as the time required to do so, can be
                  taken into consideration.  This feature was suggested by Philip Peake.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Added a number of convenience methods to the DN and RDN class that make it easier
                  to interact with them using their string representations.  For example, there are
                  now methods for determining if a string represents a valid DN or RDN, if two
                  strings represent the same DN or RDN, to determine whether there is a
                  hierarchical relationship between two strings representing DNs, and to compare
                  two DNs or RDNs based on their string representations.  This feature was
                  suggested by Felix Gaehtgens.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Updated the LDIF reader to significantly improve performance when reading entries
                  containing attributes with a large number of values (e.g., large static groups).
                  In a single-threaded test case involving reading static group entries with 2000
                  members each, performance has been improved by over 360x (i.e., over 36,000%).
                  This problem was reported by Felix Gaehtgens.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <h3>Version 0.9.5</h3>

              <p>
                This was the initial public release of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.
              </p>
