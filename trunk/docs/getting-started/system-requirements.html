              <h2>System Requirements</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a pure Java API for interacting with LDAP
                directory servers.  It requires only a Java SE 5.0 or higher environment.  It has
                been extensively tested with Java SE versions 5, 6, and 7.  It does not require
                any additional libraries that are not provided with Java SE.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java cannot be used with Java 1.4 or earlier releases,
                nor is it compatible with Java ME.  It is supported for use on the Android
                platform and can be used to create applications which run on devices using that
                platform, although some peripheral functionality (e.g., support for certain SASL
                mechanisms, including CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and GSSAPI) is not available.
              </p>
