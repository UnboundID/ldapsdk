              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a pure Java API for interacting with LDAP
                directory servers.  It requires only a Java SE 5.0 or higher environment.  It has
                been extensively tested with both Java SE 5.0 and 6.0 versions.  It does not
                require any additional libraries that are not provided with Java SE.
              </p>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java cannot be used with Java 1.4 or earlier releases,
                nor is it compatible with Java ME.  It is, however, supported for use on the
                Android platform and can be used to create applications which run on devices using
                that platform.
              </p>
